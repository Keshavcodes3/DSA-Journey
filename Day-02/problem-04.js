/*
Problem 4 — Switch-case practice (Question only)

Question: Implement a function `monthDays(month)` that uses a switch
statement to return the number of days in the given month name.

Examples:
- 'January'   -> 31
- 'February'  -> 28 (ignore leap years for this exercise)
- 'April'     -> 30

Requirements:
- Accept month names in any case (e.g., 'january', 'January').
- For unknown month names, return 'invalid'.

Do NOT include an implementation — this file should contain only the
problem description.
